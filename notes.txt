word emb exploration (adding and subtr vectors)

-----------

implementing simple RNN

implementing BiLSTM

adding dropout

network properties:
    rnn size
    rnn depth
    rnn x lstm x bilstm

explore results:
    overall acc, prec...
    results by class
    !!!comment!!

think about performance/time

! dont' spend too much time on other hparams
just make sure your learning rate works

! compare networks with similar amount of params

VG part:
implementing a different kind of LSTM (peephole connection)
